# 💚 GRAYBYTE PHP Unzipper & Zipper 💚


__Native PHP web tool for archive extraction and directory compression. It runs on almost every PHP server—even those where functions like `shell_exec` are disabled—by relying solely on PHP’s built-in capabilities.__


**🔥 Special Features:**

- **Pure Native PHP:**  
  __Uses PHP’s `ZipArchive` along with standard functions like `scandir()` and `realpath()`, eliminating the need for external shell commands.__

- **Dynamic & Responsive Popups:**  
  __Popups automatically resize based on content, ensuring that all text (especially file paths) is fully visible. File paths appear in their original case, while other interface text is transformed to uppercase.__

- **Auto-Populated Archive List:**  
  __Scans the current directory to automatically list available archives (ZIP, RAR, GZ) in a dropdown menu.__

- **Universal Compatibility:**  
  __Designed to work seamlessly on nearly all PHP-enabled servers without additional dependencies or special permissions.__

**Usage:**

1. **Unzip:**  
   __- Select an archive from the dropdown.__  
   __- Optionally specify a destination folder (defaults to the current directory).__  
   __- Click **"CLICK TO UNZIP"** to extract the files.__

2. **Zip:**  
   __- Enter a target directory path (or leave blank for the current directory).__  
   __- Click **"CLICK TO ZIP"** to compress the directory into a ZIP file named after the directory.__

**Requirements:**  
__- PHP 5.6+ (PHP 7+ recommended)__  
__- `ZipArchive` extension enabled__
